Overview:

This is a personal project that I took upon myself to create my own set of speakers. The goal was for a two-way open baffle system that performed as a dipole set of speakers. I designed and built the entire project on my own in my own personal workshop. The project took about two months from start to finish.

Contributions:

	•	Designed the speakers from scratch

	•	Manufactured and assembled speakers

Tools & Software:

	•	Personal workshop

	•	Parts Express
