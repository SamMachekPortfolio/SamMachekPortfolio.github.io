Overview:

This is a short film project made by a film student at Illinois State University. I was brought in during the post process to improve upon some "sub-par" audio as the director described it. I was able to minimize the poor sound quality as well as prepare it for a professional release to the public.

Contributions:

	•	Mastered entire project

	•	Mitigated poor audio quality

Tools & Software:

	•	Adobe Audition
