Overview:

This is a video game that I collaborated with an academic club throughout the span of three months. I communicated with the leads in the coding, art, and design departments to achieve the best sound effects and music that was required.

Contributions:

	•	Designed sound effects, including sounds for Lady Justice, The Bean character, and UI effects

	•	Composed an original looped piece for different states in the game.

Tools & Software:

	•	Adobe Audition (Sound Design)

	•	Logic Pro (Music)
