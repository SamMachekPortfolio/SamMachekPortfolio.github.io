Overview:

This is a scene from the movie "The Wild Robot", a very nature focused of story. My goal for the sound re-design here was to show the initial fear created by an unknown machine with sharp and scary looking pieces, and to then contrast that kind of emotional response in a moments notice.

Contributions:

	•	Designed all sound effects, including ambience, action, utterances, foley.

	•	Edited, processed, and mastered all final audio assets for delivery.

Tools & Software:

	•	Adobe Audition

	•	Adobe Premiere Pro

	•	Epidemic Sound
