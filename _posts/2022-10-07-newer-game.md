Overview:

This is a project that was requested by Pigfaces Martin Atkins, of whom wanted a high fidelity set of speakers for his museum of post punk & industrial music. In collaboration with an Illinois State professor I built a three way set of stereo speakers for Martin Atkins. The process took about 5 months of the actual creation of the speakers.
